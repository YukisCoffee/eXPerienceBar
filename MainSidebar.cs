/**
 * Implements the XP Sidebar proper. This is the primary insertion point for the program.
 * 
 * An ELI5 of how this works for the noobs looking through this source code (I know
 * I needed documentation when I was making this):
 * 
 *      - The sidebar is based on COM. This is an ancient, low-level Windows technology
 *        that everyone worked hard to replace in their own way, but remnants of it still
 *        remain in Windows programming. Although .net is built with interfacing with COM
 *        in mind, it's still a bit clunky. COM works through these weird ass unique GUIDs
 *        that identify each class. Apart from that, there's some evil configuration in the
 *        Solution file for this, and two DLLs will actually be spat out after compiling:
 *        .dll & .comhost.dll
 *        
 *              - The ComVisible and Guid attributes on this class help expose it to the
 *                COM world. This extends an ExplorerBarWpfProvider, which implements the
 *                actual COM registration functions (see also: ExplorerBar.RegistrationHelper).
 *                In order to register the toolbar at all, you need to run regsvr32 on the
 *                .comhost.dll binary after building. You can't register the plain .dll.
 *                
 *              - As such, this program doesn't have a Main function or anything of the sort.
 *                This class serves as the insertion point, and it is constructed by Explorer
 *                when accessing the GUID. Generally it's a good idea to avoid static properties 
 *                as they can cause memory access violations @_@
 *                
 *              - Although this program uses WPF, you'll actually notice that it isn't compiled
 *                as a Windows GUI program at all, also because this relies on COM. The main
 *                window is a user control that displays with a HwndSource.
 *                
 *      - There is no such thing as Windows Explorer. Get that in your head. It's Internet Explorer
 *        all the way down, and you'd be foolish to think otherwise. The "Desk Band" control that
 *        this implements is actually an "Explorer Bar" for Internet Explorer, and all APIs that
 *        can be used to interface with Windows Explorer are actually made for IE.
 *        
 *      - The Explorer Bar this implements actually cannot open by itself every time a new Explorer
 *        window is opened. In order to work around this, a Browser Helper Object (also an IE thing)
 *        has also been implemented, which simply hooks every Explorer window and opens the Explorer
 *        Bar for every new window. This workaround was inspired by that seen in FindeXer, an ancient
 *        custom sidebar for Windows Explorer made back in the Windows XP days.
 *                
 *      - Windows actually doesn't support custom Desk Bands (Toolbars, Explorer Bars, etc.)
 *        natively anymore. In order to get the option to enable them, you will need to install
 *        Classic Shell/Open Shell to patch Explorer to enable the option.
